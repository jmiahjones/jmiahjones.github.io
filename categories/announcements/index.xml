      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot going on recently!
In September of 2021, I was honored to win the William Jackson Hall Fellowship Award! This Fellowship awarded funding for this semester, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to focus on my research interests. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m currently using this funding to work on projects related to the issues of high-dimensionality, selection, and inference in personalized medicine. Look for a preprint related to this!
Also at the end of last year, I submitted an early version of my paper Casual Mediation Analysis: Selection with Asymptotically Valid Inference, to the ENAR 2022 Distinguished Student Paper Award competition.</description>

      <description>A happy late new year to all of you! To celebrate the new year, I&amp;rsquo;m refreshing my site with a new coat of paint. My old site was a bit too hard to manage, since it was created on top of a highly-customized Hugo theme that did not really have extensibility as a selling point. I&amp;rsquo;ve now build a new site on top of the beautiful, minimal, and highly-customizable Eureka theme, and taken this time to re-imagine how I will use the site.</description>
