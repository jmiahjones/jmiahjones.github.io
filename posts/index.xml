      <description>A happy late new year to all of you! To celebrate the new year, I&amp;rsquo;m refreshing my site with a new coat of paint. My old site was a bit too hard to manage, since it was created on top of a highly-customized Hugo theme that did not really have extensibility as a selling point. I&amp;rsquo;ve now build a new site on top of the beautiful, minimal, and highly-customizable Eureka theme, and taken this time to re-imagine how I will use the site.</description>
