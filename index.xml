      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot going on recently!
In September of 2021, I was honored to win the William Jackson Hall Fellowship Award! This Fellowship awarded funding for this semester, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to focus on my research interests. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m currently using this funding to work on projects related to the issues of high-dimensionality, selection, and inference in personalized medicine. Look for a preprint related to this!
Also at the end of last year, I submitted an early version of my paper Casual Mediation Analysis: Selection with Asymptotically Valid Inference, to the ENAR 2022 Distinguished Student Paper Award competition.</description>

      <description>It can be cold here in Rochester, but you still get a warm welcome!
I hope you enjoy perusing this site! When I&amp;rsquo;m not writing proofs, creating software, or developing new methods, I&amp;rsquo;m playing with my dog, enjoying my wife&amp;rsquo;s singing, or tinkering with technology. I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about a lot of this in this section.</description>

      <description>A happy late new year to all of you! To celebrate the new year, I&amp;rsquo;m refreshing my site with a new coat of paint. My old site was a bit too hard to manage, since it was created on top of a highly-customized Hugo theme that did not really have extensibility as a selling point. I&amp;rsquo;ve now build a new site on top of the beautiful, minimal, and highly-customizable Eureka theme, and taken this time to re-imagine how I will use the site.</description>

      <description>I am a very spirited, if not incredibly talented, guitar player. I first picked up the proverbial axe in the 8th grade, and began a lifelong study of music with its help.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the sonic effects achieved with the electric guitar. Arguably, entire sub-genres of music have evolved around certain achievable sounds with the electric guitar. From the crystalline sounds of Wes Montgomery, the gritty sounds of BB King, the cranked tones of 70&amp;rsquo;s-era Rush, to the hardly-recognizable sounds of modern metal; all these sounds are achieved by the processed sounds of magnets.</description>

      <title>Open Source</title>

      <description>What is open source software? It&amp;rsquo;s free! Not necessarily free as in &amp;ldquo;free lunch,&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;free as in freedom&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;freedom to use software without restriction, tweak the code at will, and liberty from annoying features just &amp;ldquo;because the developer said so.&amp;rdquo; Open source software allows creativity and innovation by allowing tinkerers, developers, and users to decide what they want from their software. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using open-source products and tools for years. My education and professional work has been empowered by R / Rstudio, Ubuntu, and Python.</description>
