      <description>What is open source software? It&amp;rsquo;s free! Not necessarily free as in &amp;ldquo;free lunch,&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;free as in freedom&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;freedom to use software without restriction, tweak the code at will, and liberty from annoying features just &amp;ldquo;because the developer said so.&amp;rdquo; Open source software allows creativity and innovation by allowing tinkerers, developers, and users to decide what they want from their software. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using open-source products and tools for years. My education and professional work has been empowered by R / Rstudio, Ubuntu, and Python.</description>
