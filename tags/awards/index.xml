      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot going on recently!
In September of 2021, I was honored to win the William Jackson Hall Fellowship Award! This Fellowship awarded funding for this semester, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to focus on my research interests. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m currently using this funding to work on projects related to the issues of high-dimensionality, selection, and inference in personalized medicine. Look for a preprint related to this!
Also at the end of last year, I submitted an early version of my paper Casual Mediation Analysis: Selection with Asymptotically Valid Inference, to the ENAR 2022 Distinguished Student Paper Award competition.</description>
